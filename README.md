## General Info
This project aims to apply the theories, methodologies and strategies tackled in the training to successfully implement a data warehouse to support business intelligence queries

## Introduction
About Project Info
* S&P 500 index tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on exchanges in the United States

The S&P 500 stock market index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It comprises 503 common stocks which are issued by 500 large-cap companies traded on American stock exchanges (including the 30 companies that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average). The index includes about 80 percent of the American equity market by capitalization. It is weighted by free-float market capitalization, so more valuable companies account for relatively more weight in the index. The index constituents and the constituent weights are updated regularly using rules published by S&P Dow Jones Indices.<br />

Yahoo Finance used to have their own official API, but this was decommissioned on May 15th 2017, following wide-spread misuse of data.
These days a range of unofficial APIs and libraries exist to access the same data, including of course yfinance.
Note you might know of yfinance under it’s old name- fix-yahoo-finance, since it was re-named on May 26th 2019 at the same time that it went over a large overhaul to fix some usability issues.<br />

The folder individual stocks 5yr contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. The allstocks5yr.csv contains the same data, presented in a merged .csv file. Depending on the intended use (graphing, modelling, etc.) the user may prefer one of these given formats..<br />

## Data Warehouse/Data Model
> * <ins>Why did we choose “galaxy schema”?</ins> <br />
We used **galaxy schema** in our model due to its advantages which allowing Dimension Tables to be linked to other Dimension tables, including the Dimension Tables in the first level. This Multidimensional nature makes it easy to implement on complex Relational Database systems, thus resulting in effective Analysis & Reporting processes. <br />

Here's our Dimensional Model Screenshot from SSMS.
